    <p class="insight"><span class="date">September 25, 2013</span>T-Mobile's Twitter conversation
        volume rose 52%, and News coverage increased 208%, primarily due to reports of a potential
        merger with Sprint.</p>

    <p class="insight"><span class="date">September 24, 2013</span>Sprint's Twitter conversation
        volume increased by 32%, largely due to a syndicated press release about Sprint and
        Techstars launching startup accelerator in Kansas City trending in conversation in both
        Twitter and News reports.</p>

    <p class="insight"><span class="date">September 23, 2013</span>T-Mobile's Twitter conversation
        volume remained relatively consistent; promotional tweets to celebrate the 5th year of
        collaboration between Android and T-Mobile gained traction on Twitter, but did not impact
        total conversation volume.</p>

    <p class="insight"><span class="date">September 22, 2013</span>AT&amp;T's Twitter conversation
        volume increased by 124% on Friday (09/20) with #ItCanWait continuing to trend as users
        pledged not to text and drive. Twitter volume was also driven by tweets about the new iPhone
        5S becoming available on AT&amp;T's network that day.</p>
